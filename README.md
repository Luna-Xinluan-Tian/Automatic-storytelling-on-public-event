# Automatic-storytelling-on-public-event
Social media is a new platform where people can learn about the news. However, information on social media can be overwhelmed and fragmented. Itâ€™s very important to have a platform that can aggregate all information on one public event and automatically generate stories that describe the event in human style. Here we use the online streaming of Twitter on a particular public event and use NLP techniques to extract key information about the event. Finally, human-write style stories are generated by extracting key information from tweets.
